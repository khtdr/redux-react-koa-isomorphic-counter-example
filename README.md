  - Updated to the latest React and Redux - _June 23 2018_


What is this?
=============

Bundled with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is an example
application called
[counter](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/counter).

This is an isomorphic port of the counter app using [Koa](http://koajs.com/).  It uses [isomorphic-fectch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) to load the initial state on the server, and update the state from the client. Data retrieved and set via `POST`s and `GET`s to and from the API  (`src/server/api.js`).


Installing
==========

```bash
git clone git@github.com:khtdr/redux-react-koa-isomorphic-counter-example.git
cd redux-react-koa-isomorphic-counter-example.git
npm install
```


Running
